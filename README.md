This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an element in an array that is beyond its bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an index that does not exist within the array. This can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors. The solution involves adding checks to ensure that the accessed index is within the valid range of the array.
